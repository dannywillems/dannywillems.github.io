    LeakIX is the first platform combining a search engine indexing public
    information by scanning Internet and an open reporting platform linked to the results.
    We intent to provide a preemptive solution by trusting individual researchers
    and security companies on the most sensible data we index by delivering a clear
    report on the incidents, we also help to identify what information has/could be
    affected and how to resolve the issue.
    Our first goal is one of prevention, all the voluntary reports are free
    and no sales attempts are made on LeakIX's side.
    We ban sales attempt that would take advantage of the issue to sell shady security services.
