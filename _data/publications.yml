    New Design Techniques for Efficient
    Arithmetization-Oriented Hash Functions: Anemoi Permutations and Jive
    Compression Mode
  description: |
    Advanced cryptographic protocols such as Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs of
    knowledge, widely used in cryptocurrency applications such as Zcash, Monero,
    Filecoin, demand new cryptographic hash functions that are efficient not only
    over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_{2}$, but also over large fields of
    prime characteristic $\mathbb{F}_{p}$.
    This need has been acknowledged by the wider community and new so-called
    Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) hash functions have been proposed, e.g. MiMC-Hash,
    Rescue–Prime, Poseidon, Reinforced Concrete and Griffin to name a few.

    New optimization techniques for PlonK's
    arithmetization
  description: |
    PlonK is a universal and updatable zk-SNARK for general circuit satisfiability
    that allows a verifier to check the validity of a certain NP statement very
    efficiently, optionally in zero-knowledge. PlonK requires that the NP relation
    of interest be expressed as a system of so-called PlonK constraints. Such
    conversion is complex and can be implemented in various ways, having a great
    impact on the prover complexity (which is typically linearithmic in the number
    of PlonK constraints).

    We propose several general results for simplifying PlonK constraint systems,
    which produce more compact but equivalent systems and can lead to significant
    performance improvements. We also develop an automated optimizer of constraints,
    based on our techniques, that can be used to construct very compact and less
    error-prone constraint systems, favoring a more auditable circuit design.

- title: To a typed language for modular programming
  description: |
    Modular programming consists of splitting programs in components called modules.
    In the functional programming language OCaml, the core and the module
    language are ruled by different typing systems.
    In this work, based on the calculus DOT, we develop a typing system and a
    subtyping algorithm for a language where the core and module languages
    are indistinguishable. For instance, functions and functors have the same
    types and records and modules are not different objects.
    We also describe a surface language "à la ML" making it easy to write programs. In
    addition to that, we provide an OCaml implementation of the typing and
    subtyping algorithm.
