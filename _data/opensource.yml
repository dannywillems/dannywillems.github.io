- title: "Octez: an OCaml implementation of the Tezos protocol (Dec 2019 - Present)"
  description: |
    Tezos is a blockchain that offers both consensus and meta-consensus, by which we
    mean that Tezos comes to consensus both about the state of its ledger, and also
    about how the protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

- title: "Plompiler: a monadic Domain Specific Language embedded in OCaml than can be used to build circuits for aPlonK (2021 - Present)"
  description: |
    Programs written in Plompiler are typed to increase safety and can be
    compiled to their circuit representations or interpreted directly in
    OCaml for testing.
    Together with the circuit, Plompiler also returns an efficient
    one-pass solver that given an input finds a valid assignment for the
    wires of the circuit.
    Additionally, Plompiler contains a generic optimizer capable of
    significantly reducing the size of commonly developed circuits.
    Flamegraphs can be generated to inspect the generated circuits
    and guide the optimization of each primitives.
    The library also features a highly performant set of primitives for
    hashing (Poseidon and Anemoi) and signing.
    My contribution are sporadic, e.g. when a new primitive has to be
    implemented or when peer-coding with the cryptography team at Nomadic
    Labs.

- title: "Mec: Modular Experimental Cryptography library in OCaml (April 2020 - Present)"
  description: |
    Mec provides modular implementations of (prime) finite field and elliptic
    curve cryptographic primitives like hash functions and signature schemes.
    The library aims to ease the development of (modular) experimental
    protocols in OCaml and does not aim to be used in a production environment.
    Notable users include Epoxy, an implementation of validity rollups
    integrated as a first class citizen in the Tezos protocol, for testing purposes.

- title: "ocaml-carray: contiguous C arrays in OCaml (May 2022 - Present)"
  description: |
    OCaml arrays are not always contiguous piece of memory, requiring accessing
    different chunks of memory when accessing individual elements. When requiring a
    value in memory, the CPU will fetch the RAM and load not only the particular
    value but a memory page (a contiguous piece of memory) and add it to its cache.
    The CPU will use its cache to load the values in its registers. It is not
    efficient with large OCaml arrays as the CPU will constantly fetch the RAM to
    load different memory pages in its cache.
    Also, when using the C FFI, the user must know the memory representation of an
    array and use the non user-friendly low-level interface macro Field.

    This library provides a polymorphic interface mocking a subset of the Array
    interface to work with contiguous piece of memory. Using the library should be
    as easy as adding module Array = Carray.

- title: "Seum: OCaml DSL and tool to write and compare programs in assembly, in a typed and \"safe\" fashion way (June 2022 - Present)"
  description: |
    Writing performant applications might require to write low level assembly code
    following a specific assembler syntax like GAS or NASM and when the code is
    written, OCaml developers must write boilerplate code in C and in OCaml to bind
    the hand-written assembly routines to expose it into a library.
    Also, comparing two routines implementing the same algorithm in
    assembly is hard because they might be implemented in different assembler, might
    use different ISA or request access a different number of time the memory.

    Seum aims to embed a syntax close to the NASM syntax in OCaml to write typed
    assembly program. Parsers for different assemblers are provided to be able to
    compare programs using the internal Seum representation. A cost model is
    implemented counting the number of CPU cycle each instruction requires in
    addition to counting the number of memory accesses and registers used, providing
    more precise comparisons of algorithm implementations.
    Additionnally, using the embedded syntax, OCaml bindings to the assembly code can be
    automatically generated. Calling the assembly code directly from OCaml like any
    other function should also be possible and straightforward. The OCaml developer
    has never to write assembly in a different file and can threat assembly code
    like pure OCaml functions.
