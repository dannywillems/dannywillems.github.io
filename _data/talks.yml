- title: "ZK11: o1VM: Building a Real-World zkVM for MIPS"
  description: |
    Invited talks on main stage to talk about o1VM: a zkVM we are building at o1Labs.
    In this talk, we will present o1vm, a general-purpose zkVM which can be used to
    prove the correct execution of MIPS programs. Learn about the ISA
    specifics supported by this zkVM, as well as an encoding technique for
    bitwise operations that was used to efficiently implement standard hash
    functions with high algebraic complexities like Keccak. I also dive into
    the implementation of a folding scheme and RAMLookups,
    our distinctive take on "additive lookups", and how they were leveraged to
    handle long execution traces and to efficiently represent random-memory access,
    an expensive component of zkVMs.
