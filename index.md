    Hi! I am Danny Willems. I am a mathematician with multiple interests, mostly
    related to computer sciences and theoretical physics.
    <br />
    I spend most of my time <b>trying</b> to provide a better Internet for
    everyone.
    With this mission in mind, I co-founded <a
    href="https://leakix.net">LeakIX</a> in 2021 with Gregory Boddin and we
    aim to be the Internet red team. I am also a senior cryptography engineer at <a
    href="https://o1labs.org">o1Labs</a>, a company catalyzing a new generation
    of applications powered by zero-knowledge cryptography.
    <br />
    My current interest in cryptography is incrementally verifiable computation. I
    have also been interested in arithmetization-oriented cryptographic primitives.
    On my free-time I read about cybersecurity, low-level code optimizations, formal
    verification and mathematics applied to physics. I also enjoy doing recreational
    mathematics.
    <br />
    Nowadays, I like getting my hands dirty coding in C, OCaml, Rust and read
    assembly code. Constantly requiring to be in an intellectually stimulating
    environment.
    <br />
    Regarding my personality, I am a curious person, I appreciate debating
    respectfully. I enjoy being surrounded by self-minded and respectful people,
    but I need to be in my world more than the average. In public, I might act
    as an introvert, but you will see sparkles in my eyes if you start talking
    about maths, computer sciences or sciences in general.
