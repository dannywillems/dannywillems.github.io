Back to web development...
I'm working on a small invoicing product I'd like to release in a few weeks. It
is mostly for my companies, BaDaaS and LeakIX, that I am developping it, but I
am sure that more companies will benefit from it. When a company grows, it is
time to build your own solutions. And stop using external tools. That's what I
am doing.
I started the backend two weeks ago. It works. Easy peasy. 4 hours.
Come the front. Spent an afternoon making a single page in CSS/HTML. Woooow.
Where is the jQuery time in early 2000's? I remember myself coding on an old
thinkpad, some MB of RAM, teenager, making some simple webpages with links,
uploading with FileZilla to my 128MB RAM, Celeron server.
Anyway... Let's go back.
We've got to evolve with the industry. Let's do it.


So. Starting with the new terms in the CSS ecosystem.
It seems people came with some names to classify classes.
I started reading [SMACCS](http://smacss.com/book/). I recommend. No summary to
make. Pretty straightforward.
