Academic knowledge is locked behind paywalls. Publishers charge $30-50 per
article, and institutional subscriptions cost universities millions per year.
Meanwhile, researchers receive no royalties from these sales, and publicly
funded research remains inaccessible to the public that funded it.

This page lists tools and resources to access research papers, organized from
fully legal open access platforms to shadow libraries.

## Open access platforms and tools

### OpenAlex

[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) is a fully open catalog of the global research
system, named after the ancient Library of Alexandria. Built by the nonprofit
[OurResearch](https://github.com/ourresearch), it launched in January 2022 as a
successor to the discontinued Microsoft Academic Graph. OpenAlex indexes over
250 million scholarly works, including articles, datasets, books, and
dissertations. The entire dataset is available under the CC0 license via a web
GUI, REST API, and full data dump.

### Unpaywall

[Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) is a free, open-source browser extension for
Chrome and Firefox, also made by [OurResearch](https://github.com/ourresearch).
When you view a paywalled journal article, Unpaywall checks its database of over
49 million legal, open-access articles. If an open version exists, a green tab
appears on the page. Click the tab and read for free, legally. The
[source code](https://github.com/ourresearch/unpaywall-extension) is available
on GitHub.

### arXiv

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) is the original preprint server, founded in 1991 by
Paul Ginsparg at Los Alamos National Laboratory (now hosted by Cornell
University). It hosts over 2.4 million preprints in physics, mathematics,
computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics,
electrical engineering, and economics. Papers are freely accessible without any
paywall.

### PubMed Central

[PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) (PMC) is a free full-text
archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National
Institutes of Health. It provides free access to over 10 million articles. The
NIH public access policy mandates that research funded by NIH be deposited in
PMC within 12 months of publication.

### CORE

[CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) is the world's largest collection of open-access
research papers, aggregating over 250 million articles from more than 30,000
sources worldwide. It harvests content from institutional and subject
repositories, and open access journals.

### Semantic Scholar

[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) is an AI-powered academic
search engine developed by the Allen Institute for AI. It indexes over 200
million papers across all fields of science and uses machine learning to surface
relevant results, extract key figures and tables, and provide citation context.

### DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals)

[DOAJ](https://doaj.org/) indexes over 20,000 peer-reviewed open-access journals
that meet strict quality criteria. It serves as a whitelist for legitimate
open-access publishing.

### bioRxiv and medRxiv

[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) (biology) and
[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) (medicine) are preprint servers operated by
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. They host manuscripts before formal peer review.

### SSRN

[SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com/) (Social Science Research Network) hosts preprints
in social sciences, humanities, and law. Now owned by Elsevier, but still
provides free access to most papers.

### Internet Archive

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) and its
[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) project provide access to millions of
books through controlled digital lending. The Wayback Machine can also surface
older versions of papers that were once freely available.

### Google Scholar

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) indexes approximately 400 million
academic documents. While it doesn't host papers directly, it links to free
versions when available, including preprints and author-hosted copies.

### BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine)

[BASE](https://www.base-search.net/) is operated by Bielefeld University Library
in Germany. It provides access to over 400 million documents from more than
11,000 content providers, with a strong focus on open-access resources.

### Open Access Button

[Open Access Button](https://openaccessbutton.org/) is a browser extension and
web tool that searches for free, legal copies of research papers. If no free
copy exists, it can automatically send an access request to the author.

## Shadow libraries

Shadow libraries are collections of copyrighted content made available without
permission from copyright holders. They exist because the current academic
publishing model charges for access to publicly funded research while paying
nothing to the researchers who produce it. For a broader context, see the
Wikipedia article on
[shadow libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library).

### Sci-Hub

[Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/) was created in 2011 by Alexandra Elbakyan, a
Kazakhstani graduate student who could not afford access to papers she needed
for her research. It provides free access to over 85 million research papers by
bypassing publisher paywalls. Sci-Hub is the most widely used shadow library for
academic papers, and has been the subject of multiple lawsuits from publishers
like Elsevier and Springer Nature. Domain names change frequently due to legal
action.

### Library Genesis (LibGen)

[Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) is one of the oldest and largest shadow
libraries, hosting over 2.4 million non-fiction books, 80 million scientific
articles, 2.2 million fiction books, and hundreds of thousands of comics and
magazine issues. It started in the early 2000s from Russian scientific and
academic communities. Like Sci-Hub, its domain changes frequently.

### Z-Library

[Z-Library](https://z-lib.org/) began as a mirror of Library Genesis but has
since expanded to include works not available on LibGen. It was one of the
largest online libraries before law enforcement operations in 2022 seized its
domains and led to the arrest of two alleged operators. It has since relaunched
using alternative access methods.

### Anna's Archive

[Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/) is an open-source search engine and
metasearch for shadow libraries. It was launched in 2022 by the pseudonymous
"Anna" shortly after the Z-Library seizure. It aggregates records from Library
Genesis, Sci-Hub, Z-Library, and other sources into a single searchable
interface. Previously known as Pirate Library Mirror (PLIMI). See also the
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive).

### Memory of the World

[Memory of the World](https://www.memoryoftheworld.org/) is a network of
interconnected shadow libraries, each maintained locally and independently. It
focuses on critical theory, philosophy, and humanities texts, operating as a
decentralized collective.

### The Anarchist Library

[The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/) is an open archive
focused on anarchism and related topics. It hosts texts in multiple languages
and formats.

### UbuWeb

[UbuWeb](https://ubu.com/) is an online archive of avant-garde art, founded by
conceptual artist Kenneth Goldsmith. It hosts a vast collection of sound, film,
video, and text works that are difficult or impossible to find elsewhere.

### AAAAARG

AAAAARG (Artists, Architects, and Activists Reading Group) was an online text
repository created by artist Sean Dockray in 2005. It focused on critical
theory, art, and architecture texts. As of 2025, it is offline.

### Monoskop

[Monoskop](https://monoskop.org/) is a wiki for collaborative studies of the
arts, media, and humanities. It hosts a significant collection of texts, books,
and resources related to media art, digital culture, and critical theory.

## Other strategies

### Emailing the author

Researchers receive no money from publisher paywalls. Most will happily send you
a PDF of their paper if you email them directly. Look for the corresponding
author's email address in the abstract or on their institutional page.

### Your local library

Public and university libraries often provide free access to academic databases
like JSTOR, Web of Science, and Scopus. Some libraries offer remote access
through digital borrowing programs. Many countries have national licensing
agreements that provide broader access.

### Interlibrary loan (ILL)

If your library does not have access to a specific paper, you can request it
through interlibrary loan. This is a free service offered by most academic and
public libraries.

### ResearchGate and Academia.edu

Researchers often upload copies of their own papers to
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) and
[Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/). These self-archived copies are
typically legal under the "green open access" provisions of most publisher
agreements.

### Social media

Posting the DOI or title of a paper on Twitter/X with the hashtag `#ICanHazPDF`
is a long-standing tradition in the academic community. Someone with
institutional access will often send you the paper.
