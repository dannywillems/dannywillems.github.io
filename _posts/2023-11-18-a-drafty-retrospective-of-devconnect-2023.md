I will maybe edit this later...

[Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/) is ending. We are the 18 November 2023. It
was for me my first Devconnect. The first time I went public to an Ethereum
event. It was also my first time at a [ZK Hack](https://zkhack.dev/). And I have
to be honest, I have been astonished by how the industry is growing. I cannot
make a list of the projects, papers and codes as I struggle remember all of
them. Even a small part.

The privacy-preserving industry, using in particular zero-knowledge
cryptography, becomes sensitively more serious. VC seeks good builders, founders
and researchers. And the results are there. We can do better of course. But wow.
Very hard to catch up with everything. I realised I was late on so many things.

But still. I realised there are projects that do not make sense and should not
exist. I won't give name of course. I also met people only there to put
themselves forward, without actually thinking about the goods they can do for
the industry. I met PM and builders that were trashing on their previous
companies they moved from recently or simply on competitors. That is lame. We
try to do our best, we invest our time in communities.

I want to emphasize that we are on a mission. We are here to _try_ to buidl a
better Internet, to buidl a safer Internet. It is only the beginning of a very
long journey.

To grow in the industry, we have to stay humble. We have to continue to build.
We have to continue to read.

Oh, and more importantly, I didn't try to be a frog master :(. I know some
friends did though :).

Very drafty post. Some minutes before going to Aleo party. Nothing technical or
scientific, I know. Only some words to make sentences. Next for me will be the
[0xVillage](https://0xvillage.org/), before continuing to build and learn. And
write docs. And write tests. Of course.
