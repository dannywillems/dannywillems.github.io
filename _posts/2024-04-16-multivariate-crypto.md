Interesting reading: [Signature of correct
computations](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/587.pdf) (sometimes called PST'13,
because accepted at TCC13).

Describe a multivariate polynomial commitment scheme based on some observations from KZG10.

I like the multiset representation of a multivariate polynomial, section 2.4.
Also, good description of KZG, see 1.3.
