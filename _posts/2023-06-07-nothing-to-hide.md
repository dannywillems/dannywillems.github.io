Some documentaries deserve to be watched by everyone. [Nothing to
hide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djbwzEIv7gE) is one of those.

Even though most sentences deserve to be transcripted, I picked some I particularly like:

> I like talking about intimacy, and if fundamental rights seem like something remote, something you may not want to care about, because you know you have to fill your fridge, you have to pay the rent, you have to wipe the baby's ass, and whatnot then intimacy is not what you're willing to give up, you understand what it means. Intimacy is those spaces where you are truly yourself either alone, or with people you decide to share this intimacy with. Intimacy is when you're naked, either as a metaphor or real. It is when you can experiment with yourself. You can experiment with new ideas, with new concepts, with new practices, without being judged by your peers. If you're in the middle of a crowd of hundreds people and take a guitar and think "ah, what would it do if I played like this Kling Klong Klong?". You would never do it. If you're alone in your bedroom, with that guitar, you do the Kling Klang Klong and maybe it sounds like shit. And you try again. And again and again and again and again. And maybe after 1000 times you'll feel ready to have another person listen to it and maybe after 10 000 times you'll feel ready to have 100 people listen to it. It is because you have an opportunity in your intimacy to experiment without being judged that you can make mistakes, with no cost. It's because of that that you can develop your personality. This is what we are being robbed.

> Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying that you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say but the bottom line here is even if you're not using a given right at this precise moment other people do saying that you don't care about it right because you're not using it personally is the most antisocial thing you can possibly say what it's saying is that I don't care about other people now particularly if this is being said by someone who occupies a position of privilege you know if you're a rich old white guy sitting on the very top of society you don't care what the laws are you don't care what the rights are because Society is ordered to protect your interest it's the minorities who always face the greatest risk
