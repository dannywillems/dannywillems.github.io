Let's talk about effective altruism. Some thoughts came from an old notebook I
had when I was a teenager. I don't really remember the exact time. But, whatever
right? Time is not absolute. We don't care which period of my life I had these
thoughts.

I might be thinking differently than most speeches we hear around "you can help
third world countries by giving X Y amount of money".

Of course, it is still altruism. Food, with health, are the one of the only
resources we actually need as a living human animal.

I think altruism is not about how many lives you saved, how much money you gave
to X, Y, Z. There are so many fights. And the fights also depend on the values
we have.

I would define my vision of altruism as a quantity you give people to make them
enjoying life, and try to maximise the number of people you impact. The altruism
function can be seen a multivariate polynomials, and you have some variables
defining your happiness, and some independent that maximizes the happiness of
others. I would define an effective altruism where over time, the function
increases on average more on the independent variables of your happiness, and
minimize the variables that increases the variables that are not vital, while
still keeping a non-negligeable level of self-hapiness (by writing these lines,
I should read more about utilitarianism...).

Altruism is not only about food or medecines. It is about efficiently use your
skills and time to increase the function as describe above.
